# ‚òÅÔ∏è Leveraging Splunk Cloud for log aggregation and analysis

## üìñ Overview
This documentation outlines the process of configuring **Splunk Cloud** to receive and analyze log data from both **Windows** and **Linux** instances using **Universal Forwarders (UF)**. The goal of this project is to develop hands-on experience with **log aggregation, security monitoring, and Splunk Processing Language (SPL)** within my **HomeLab setup**.  

## üéØ Goals
- **Ingest and analyse system logs** from Windows and Linux endpoints.  
- **Perform scenario-based investigations** to detect and respond to security events.  
- **Utilise Splunk‚Äôs Searching & Reporting app** to query, visualize, and analyze data.  
- **Integrate AWS CloudWatch logs** to explore cloud-based security monitoring. 

### Learning & Practical Applications  
- Hands-on experience with **Splunk Universal Forwarders**.  
- Understanding **SPL queries** for event correlation and threat detection.  
- Investigating **custom scenario-based log data** for security analysis.  
- Expanding knowledge in **cloud security services (AWS CloudWatch & CloudTrail)**.
