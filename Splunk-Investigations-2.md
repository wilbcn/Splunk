# üîç Splunk Cloud: Detecting Unauthorised Admin Account Creation

## üìñ Overview
This project is a continuation of my Splunk series, aimed at gaining hands-on experience with the Splunk platform and learning how to use the Splunk Processing Language (SPL) effectively to investigate and report on security events. 
In this follow-up, I explore and continue learning key Splunk features such as alerts** and dashboards, while aligning all detection and mitigation strategies with the MITRE ATT&CK framework to mirror real-world security operations.
This projects focuses on unauthorised administrator account creation and privilege escalation on a Windows machine ‚Äî a critical persistence tactic used by adversaries (MITRE Technique: `T1098 - Account Manipulation`).

To carry out this project, I configured universal forwaders on some EC2 instances.

## üéØ Goals  
‚úÖ Detect the creation of new administrator accounts on a Windows system.  
‚úÖ Gain hands-on experience with SPL to perform targeted threat investigations.  
‚úÖ Build real-time alerts to notify of privilege escalation events.  
‚úÖ Design a Splunk dashboard to visualize account manipulation activity.  
‚úÖ Align all detection and mitigation techniques with the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

### üîç MITRE ATT&CK Framework Integration  
This project strengthens my understanding of adversary behavior by simulating account manipulation techniques and aligning detection strategies with the MITRE ATT&CK framework. By leveraging SPL, alerts, and dashboards, I aim to replicate how a SOC analyst would monitor for and respond to suspicious privilege escalation attempts.

| **Tactic**            | **MITRE Technique**                | **Simulated Test**                              | **Expected Detection** |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Persistence**       | `T1098 - Account Manipulation`     | Create a new admin account in Windows           | `index=* sourcetype="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode=4720` |
| **Detection Strategy**| `DS0028 - Account Creation Monitoring` | Alert on the creation of privileged user accounts | `index=* sourcetype="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode=4720 OR EventCode=4732` |
| **Mitigation Strategy**| `M1018 - User Account Management` | Implement strict user provisioning policies & monitor admin group membership | GPO enforcement, privileged group auditing |

## Project walk-through  
This section provides a step-by-step breakdown of the work carried out in this Splunk project. It demonstrates my ability to simulate adversarial tactics, detect privilege escalation using SPL, and take action through real-time alerts and visual dashboards. As with previous projects, this serves both as a practical security learning experience and a documented workflow I can refer to in the future.
