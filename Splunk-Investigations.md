# üîç Splunk Cloud: Scenario-Based Investigations, Alerts & Dashboards  

## üìñ Overview
This is the follow up project to my initial Splunk Cloud setup with Universal Forwarders on both a Windows & Linux machine. In this project, I aim to carry simulate real-world security scenarios, perform further SPL queries, and create alerts and dashboards, to develop a deeper understanding of Splunk and to gain hands-on experience. This will also serve me well as I soon intend to take the Blue Team Level 1 certifcation exam. 

## üéØ Goals
- Simulate security events for log analysis and threat detection.
- Perform more advanced SPL searches to hands-on experience and development.
- Create real-time alerts for security incidents.  
- Develop dashboards for proactive log monitoring and visualisation.  

### Learning & Practical Applications  
- Building scenario-based investigations for real-world security analysis.  
- Learning SPL techniques for anomaly detection & log correlation.  
- Automating security monitoring with alerts & scheduled reports.  
- Designing Splunk dashboards for continuous security insights.

## Project walk-through
This section provides a step-by-step breakdown of the process followed in this follow-up Splunk project. It demonstrates my enthusiasm for learning industry-relevant tools and developing the skills essential for an aspiring cybersecurity professional. Additionally, this serves as a learning resource that I can refer back to as I continue expanding my expertise.
