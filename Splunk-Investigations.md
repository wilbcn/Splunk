# üîç Splunk Cloud: Scenario-Based Investigations, Alerts & Dashboards  

## üìñ Overview
This is a follow up project to my initial Splunk Cloud setup with Universal Forwarders on both a Windows & Linux machine. In this project, I aim to simulate real-world security scenarios, perform further SPL queries, and create alerts and dashboards, to develop a deeper understanding of Splunk and to gain hands-on experience. To accompany this documentation, I will refer to the MITRE ATTACK framework, referencing real world examples for prevention and detection strategies. 

I will then leverage the knowledge gained to assist me in the Blue Team Level 1 certifcation exam. 

## üéØ Goals
- Simulate security events for log analysis and threat detection.
- Perform more advanced SPL searches to hands-on experience and development.
- Create real-time alerts for security incidents.  
- Utilise the MITRE ATTACK Framework to align with real-world adversary tactics.
- Develop dashboards for proactive log monitoring and visualisation.

### üîç MITRE ATT&CK Framework Integration  
This project also allowed me to gain essential experience using MITRE ATT&CK. By structuring our tests and detections based on MITRE techniques, I can ensure our Splunk implementation mirrors industry best practices for security monitoring. Below are the MITRE techniques referred to in this project, which I carried out during the practical tests. 

| **Tactic** | **MITRE Technique** | **Simulated Test** | **Expected Detection** |
|------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Credential Access** | `T1003.008 - OS Credential Dumping` | Unprivileged user attempts to read `/etc/shadow` | `index=linux_logs sourcetype=linux:audit file IN ("/etc/passwd", "/etc/shadow")` |
| **Persistence** | `T1098 - Account Manipulation` | New admin account creation | `index=linux_logs sourcetype=linux:auth EventCode=4720` |

## Project walk-through
This section provides a step-by-step breakdown of the process followed in this follow-up Splunk project. It demonstrates my enthusiasm for learning industry-relevant tools and developing the skills essential for an aspiring cybersecurity professional. Additionally, this serves as a learning resource that I can refer back to as I continue expanding my expertise.

### 1. Carrying out scenario-based Security Events in Linux
Generating security incidents to later analyse in Splunk. Overview of each security event and commands used.

### 1.1 OS Credential Dumping
- Unprivileged user attempts to read `/etc/passwd` (ID: T1003.008)

### 1.2 Configure AuditD

For this test, I had to configure and enable AuditD. This audit logs, I could send changes to files such as `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` from our UF to Splunk Cloud. On our Linux machine as splunkadmin:
- Install and Enable AuditD
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install auditd -y
sudo systemctl start auditd  
sudo systemctl enable auditd
```

- Verify AuditD is Running
```
sudo systemctl status auditd
```

-  Add Audit Rules for Unauthorised Access to /etc/passwd and /shadow
```
sudo auditctl -w /etc/passwd -p r -k passwd-access
sudo auditctl -w /etc/shadow -p r -k shadow-access
```

- Check Active Audit rules
```
sudo auditctl -l

-w /etc/passwd -p r -k passwd-access
-w /etc/shadow -p r -k shadow-access
```

- Persist Audit Rules (append to bottom of file)
```
sudo vi /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules

-w /etc/passwd -p r -k passwd-access
-w /etc/shadow -p r -k shadow-access
```

- Apply the changes
```
sudo systemctl restart auditd
```

- Forward AuditD Logs to Splunk
```
sudo nano /opt/splunkforwarder/etc/system/local/inputs.conf

[monitor:///var/log/audit/audit.log]
index = linux_logs
sourcetype = linux:audit
```

- Restart splunk UF
```
sudo systemctl restart SplunkForwarder
```

### 1.3 Simulating unauthorised access
Here I simulated access attempts from our non-admin user account to `/etc/shadow`. This is a system file in Linux that stores encrypted user passwords and is accessible only to the root user. Attempted access could be a potential security risk, and something we can simulate and take proactive action against in this project.

SPL Query: index=linux_logs sourcetype=linux:audit "shadow-access" success=no

- By expanding on these log entries, we are able to identify valuable information about this event.

| **Field**      | **Value**                           | **Explanation** |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|----------------|
| **`_time`**   | `2025-03-18T12:32:06.728+00:00`   | Timestamp of the event. |
| **`UID`**     | `badguy`                          | The user attempting access. |
| **`key`**     | `shadow-access`                   | AuditD rule matched (attempt to access `/etc/shadow`). |
| **`success`** | `no`                              | Access attempt **failed**. |
| **`exit`**    | `-13`                             | **Permission Denied** (`EACCES` error). |

- This confirms that `badguy` attempted to access `/etc/shadow` but was denied due to insufficient permissions. Referring to the MITRE ATT&CK Framework (T1003.008 - /etc/shadow Credential Dumping), we can enhance our detection capabilities by implementing Detection Strategy `DS0022`, on File Access.

### 1.4 Creating the alert
Now to create the alert in Splunk. After performing the SPL query, we can click save-as alert.

The alert was then created with an appropriate title and description. The cron job was set to every 5 minutes. I left the expiration at 24 hours as we are only testing. The trigger conditions were set so we would receive an alert each time the conditions were met.

The alert was then configured to send to my email address (left blank for privacy reasons). With an appropriate subject and priority level.

### 1.5 Triggering the alert.
Back in my Linux machine, I once again attempted to access `/etc/shadow` from our non-admin user. This successfully generated an alert, and I was notified via email!
