# üîç Splunk Cloud: Splunk Cloud: Detecting & Mitigating Unauthorised Access to Sensitive Files

## üìñ Overview
This project expands upon my Splunk Cloud setup with Universal Forwarders by focusing on a specific security scenario: securing /etc/shadow and /etc/passwd from unauthorized access attempts.
The goal is to detect, alert, and mitigate potential threats using Splunk SPL searches, alerts, and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

By structuring our detection and response techniques around MITRE's T1003.008 (OS Credential Dumping), I ensure alignment with real-world security methodologies. This project also serves as a learning resource for developing Blue Team skills, including log analysis, alerting, and security monitoring.

## üéØ Goals
‚úÖ Detect unauthorized access attempts on /etc/shadow and /etc/passwd.
‚úÖ Create real-time alerts for security monitoring.
‚úÖ Apply MITRE ATT&CK-aligned detection & mitigation strategies.
‚úÖ Implement group-based access controls to proactively restrict access.
‚úÖ Develop a structured approach to security monitoring in Splunk Cloud.

### üîç MITRE ATT&CK Framework Integration  
This project also allowed me to gain essential experience using MITRE ATT&CK. By structuring our tests and detections based on MITRE techniques, I can ensure our Splunk implementation mirrors industry best practices for security monitoring. Below are the MITRE techniques referred to in this project, which I carried out during the practical tests. 

| **Tactic** | **MITRE Technique** | **Simulated Test** | **Expected Detection** |
|------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Credential Access** | `T1003.008 - OS Credential Dumping` | Unprivileged user attempts to read `/etc/shadow` | `index=linux_logs sourcetype=linux:audit file IN ("/etc/passwd", "/etc/shadow")` |
| **Detection Strategy** | `DS0022 - File Access Monitoring` | Create an alert based on secure file access violations | `index=linux_logs sourcetype=linux:audit "shadow-access" success=no` |
| **Mitigation Strategy** | `M1026 - Privileged Account Management` | Restrict file access using ACLs & Group-Based Policies | `setfacl -m g:general_users:--- /etc/shadow` |

## Project walk-through
This section provides a step-by-step breakdown of the process followed in this follow-up Splunk project. It demonstrates my enthusiasm for learning industry-relevant tools and developing the skills essential for an aspiring cybersecurity professional. Additionally, this serves as a learning resource that I can refer back to as I continue expanding my expertise.

### 1. Carrying out scenario-based Security Events in Linux
Generating security incidents to later analyse in Splunk. Overview of each security event and commands used.

### 1.1 OS Credential Dumping
- Unprivileged user attempts to read `/etc/shadow` (ID: T1003.008)

### 1.2 Configure AuditD

For this test, I had to configure and enable AuditD. This audit logs, I could send changes to files such as `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` from our UF to Splunk Cloud. On our Linux machine as splunkadmin:
- Install and Enable AuditD
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install auditd -y
sudo systemctl start auditd  
sudo systemctl enable auditd
```

- Verify AuditD is Running
```
sudo systemctl status auditd
```

-  Add Audit Rules for Unauthorised Access to /etc/passwd and /shadow
```
sudo auditctl -w /etc/passwd -p r -k passwd-access
sudo auditctl -w /etc/shadow -p r -k shadow-access
```

- Check Active Audit rules
```
sudo auditctl -l

-w /etc/passwd -p r -k passwd-access
-w /etc/shadow -p r -k shadow-access
```

- Persist Audit Rules (append to bottom of file)
```
sudo vi /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules

-w /etc/passwd -p r -k passwd-access
-w /etc/shadow -p r -k shadow-access
```

- Apply the changes
```
sudo systemctl restart auditd
```

- Forward AuditD Logs to Splunk
```
sudo nano /opt/splunkforwarder/etc/system/local/inputs.conf

[monitor:///var/log/audit/audit.log]
index = linux_logs
sourcetype = linux:audit
```

- Restart splunk UF
```
sudo systemctl restart SplunkForwarder
```

### 1.3 Simulating unauthorised access
Here I simulated access attempts from our non-admin user account to `/etc/shadow`. This is a system file in Linux that stores encrypted user passwords and is accessible only to the root user. Attempted access could be a potential security risk, and something we can simulate and take proactive action against in this project.

SPL Query: index=linux_logs sourcetype=linux:audit "shadow-access" success=no

- By expanding on these log entries, we are able to identify valuable information about this event.

| **Field**      | **Value**                           | **Explanation** |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|----------------|
| **`_time`**   | `2025-03-18T12:32:06.728+00:00`   | Timestamp of the event. |
| **`UID`**     | `badguy`                          | The user attempting access. |
| **`key`**     | `shadow-access`                   | AuditD rule matched (attempt to access `/etc/shadow`). |
| **`success`** | `no`                              | Access attempt **failed**. |
| **`exit`**    | `-13`                             | **Permission Denied** (`EACCES` error). |

- This confirms that `badguy` attempted to access `/etc/shadow` but was denied due to insufficient permissions.

### 1.4 Creating the alert
Referring to the MITRE ATT&CK Framework (T1003.008 - /etc/shadow Credential Dumping), we can enhance our detection capabilities by creating an alert on Files Access attempts - Detection Strategy `DS0022`. After performing the SPL query, we can click save-as alert.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8d4ada7-4c75-43fa-ba7c-b44d16b51490)

The alert was then created with an appropriate title and description. The cron job was set to every 5 minutes. I left the expiration at 24 hours as we are only testing. The trigger conditions were set so we would receive an alert each time the conditions were met.

The alert was then configured to send to my email address (left blank for privacy reasons). With an appropriate subject and priority level.

### 1.5 Triggering the alert.
Back in my Linux machine, I once again attempted to access `/etc/shadow` from our non-admin user. This successfully generated an alert, and I was notified via email!

### 1.6 Mitigation techniques
After detecting unauthorised access attempts, I implement M1026 - Privileged Account Management to proactively restrict access to sensitive files. Instead of blocking users individually, I applied group-based restrictions to ensure that only privileged users can access `/etc/shadow` while logging violations for security monitoring.

- Current ownership and permissions. Only users in the shadow group have access to `/etc/shadow`

```
ls -l /etc/shadow /etc/passwd
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   2014 Mar 18 10:30 /etc/passwd
-rw-r----- 1 root shadow 1135 Mar 18 10:30 /etc/shadow
```

- I then created some test users, and a general users group to add all non-admin users to.

e.g.
```
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash tomsmith
sudo passwd tomsmith
New password:
Retype new password:
passwd: password updated successfully
```

```
sudo addgroup general_users
[sudo] password for splunkadmin:
info: Selecting GID from range 1000 to 59999 ...
info: Adding group `general_users' (GID 1004) ...
```

- Test user was then added to the new group

```
sudo usermod -aG general_users tomsmith
splunkadmin@ip:~$ groups tomsmith
tomsmith : tomsmith general_users
```

- Now tomsmith belongs to general_users, which we will restrict. Firstly, I installed the ACL package.

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install acl -y
```

- Applying group based restrictions. These commands remove `rwx` permissions for our `general_users` group on `/etc/shadow`, and read access only on `/etc/passwd`.
```
sudo setfacl -m g:general_users:--- /etc/shadow
sudo setfacl -m g:general_users:r-- /etc/passwd
```

- Confirming the ACL changes

```
getfacl /etc/shadow
getfacl: Removing leading '/' from absolute path names
# file: etc/shadow
# owner: root
# group: shadow
user::rw-
group::r--
group:general_users:---
mask::r--
other::---

getfacl /etc/passwd
getfacl: Removing leading '/' from absolute path names
# file: etc/passwd
# owner: root
# group: root
user::rw-
group::r--
group:general_users:r--
mask::r--
other::r--
```

- Standard users can read `passwd` by default, however, applying an explicit ACL (r-- for general_users) ensures we maintain control over access permissions, even if system defaults change in the future. Next I tested the applied changes. 

```
tomsmith@ip:~$ cat /etc/shadow
cat: /etc/shadow: Permission denied

tomsmith@ip:~$ cat /etc/passwd

Allowed!
```
